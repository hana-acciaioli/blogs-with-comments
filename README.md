# Demo Blogs with Comments

## Warm Up Instructions

1. Clone the template to your own github
2. Get the two routes in the blogs controller passing

_Note that the approach for adding comments to blogs is different from how we have done it in the past with JSON blobs -- read through the model functions and see if you can figure it out_

## Demo

1. Review the GET routes including new approach to add related records
1. Demo refactor of test code when needing logged in users
1. Demo adding related records (comments)
1. Demo deleting comments
1. Deploy!
